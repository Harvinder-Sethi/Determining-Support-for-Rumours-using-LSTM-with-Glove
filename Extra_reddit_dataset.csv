Reply,dfxaofh,63uefi,"&gt; Mr Trump has spent seven weekends at Mar-a-Lago since taking office ten weeks ago. It is estimated that each of these trips costs at least $3 million (£2.4 million), covering the President’s extensive security detail.

I was actually wrong, but my overall point remains correct. It seems to say that the security detail has more people in it on trips outside the White House, which makes plenty of sense.

*Answer*, however, is not a borrowed word, but an English word which was introduced to the English lexicon from the Proto-Germanic language. This is because English developed with influence from the Germanic people coming to England hundreds of years ago, notably the Frisians, Saxons, and Danes. When they went to England, whether trading or settling, the English language evolved to accommodate. 

So now you see what I mean? There is German influence from pre-Old English that have Germanic origins from hundreds of years ago, and there are German words that English borrowed very recently without changing or integrating the word.

Reply,chfogbk,25bvmb,"Actually, he is right, kind of.  Though nicotine can have bad side effects in excess (as almost all drugs, including caffeine) and is very addictive (roughly as addictive as morphine) the main health problems associated with smoking concern the build up of carcinogens and various oxidants that cause a myriad of physiological damage that would take me a few hours to type out comprehensively.  Nicotine itself is not considered carcinogenic, which is why nicotine therapies (like a patch) are favored over cigarette use.  It gives the person the nicotine fix (albeit, less effective than inhaling) without loading down your body with the huge list of added chemicals in cigarettes.  

Is nicotine good for you?  No, its not.  It can cause hypertension, birth problems, and a few other minor problems.  However, caffeine and ethanol are both ""not good"" for you in most contexts, and its all about weighing out their potential health risks with whatever value we place on their psychoactive effects.  It is absolutely true, though, that cigarettes carry with them a lot of baggage that causes many of the health problems associated with smoking, and the only reason people smoke is because of nicotine, so in that sense it is the ""worst"" thing in a cig.

Just to add some primary literature to this, here is an excerpt from Uptodate, which is paid access so you cannot see it.

&gt;NICOTINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK — Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [11-13]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of LDL, and platelet activation.

Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction


Also, wikipedia has alot of this information.

Now, your friend may think an e cig is absolutely safe.  This is a dubious claim, since, not only does nicotine have some negative side effects, but the current regulations on e cigs are effectively non-existent.  This means their may be some other various chemicals that make them unsafe.  They are a fairly new thing so research is insufficient.  My personal opinion is that they are definitely more safe than cigarettes, less safe than nothing at all, but a potentially excellent smoking cessation therapy option that could get people to stop smoking.",None,support

Reply,cb2i98n,1i8ljs,"There are two NSA programs – one that gathers U.S. phone records (metadata) and another that is designed  to track the use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism.

You are mixing info on the two in a failed attempt to make a point.

Phone metadata: This includes the “call pairs” — the two phone numbers on a call, plus the date, time and duration of the call.

Email metadata: The “to” and “from” email addresses, along with the IP addresses and subject lines. Basically it’s the same information you’d see on the envelope of a postal letter.

Similar metadata *WAS* collected for text messages, Facebook DMs and the like. The purpose of metadata is to weed out your cat meme emails, which NSA doesn’t care about nor does it read or retain, and to zero in on real suspects for targeted surveillance (which, as you’ll read below, requires an individual warrant for U.S. persons).

What is “minimization?” This is the procedure NSA uses to safeguard the privacy of American citizens. Part of this process includes the anonymization/encryption of personal information, transforming proper names, for example, into random strings of characters called “designators.”

http://thedailybanter.com/2013/07/a-stellar-wind-primer-what-exactly-are-we-talking-about-regarding-the-nsa/

The Washington Post has revised its article. Just one day later, with no acknowledgment except for a 
change in the timestamp, the Post revised the story, 
backing down from sensational claims it made originally. But the damage was already done. 
The article no longer reports that the tech companies gave 
the NSA ""Unrestricted direct access to servers"". 
But, more importantly, the phrase “track a person’s movements and contacts over time” was revised to 
“track foreign targets.” There’s a huge difference between the two phrases. 
Public outrage was almost entirely based on the idea that the NSA was spying on everyone who uses those services, 
broad, unrestricted access to private information. 
But the revision limits the scope of the operation to *international communications*.

Reply,cb2i98n,1i8ljs,"There are two NSA programs – one that gathers U.S. phone records (metadata) and another that is designed  to track the use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to terrorism.

You are mixing info on the two in a failed attempt to make a point.

Phone metadata: This includes the “call pairs” — the two phone numbers on a call, plus the date, time and duration of the call.

Email metadata: The “to” and “from” email addresses, along with the IP addresses and subject lines. Basically it’s the same information you’d see on the envelope of a postal letter.

Similar metadata *WAS* collected for text messages, Facebook DMs and the like. The purpose of metadata is to weed out your cat meme emails, which NSA doesn’t care about nor does it read or retain, and to zero in on real suspects for targeted surveillance (which, as you’ll read below, requires an individual warrant for U.S. persons).

What is “minimization?” This is the procedure NSA uses to safeguard the privacy of American citizens. Part of this process includes the anonymization/encryption of personal information, transforming proper names, for example, into random strings of characters called “designators.”

The Washington Post has revised its article. Just one day later, with no acknowledgment except for a 
change in the timestamp, the Post revised the story, 
backing down from sensational claims it made originally. But the damage was already done. 
The article no longer reports that the tech companies gave 
the NSA ""Unrestricted direct access to servers"". 
But, more importantly, the phrase “track a person’s movements and contacts over time” was revised to 
“track foreign targets.” There’s a huge difference between the two phrases. 
Public outrage was almost entirely based on the idea that the NSA was spying on everyone who uses those services, 
broad, unrestricted access to private information. 
But the revision limits the scope of the operation to *international communications*.

Reply,cgoq9oi,22o24j,"This claim comes from 'Man Against Fire' by S.L.A. Marshall, who was a US Army historian for WW2. He's fairly controversial, as is the book, and the 15%-20% figure comes from his book, although it's misquoted.

For one, he's basing it off interviews he did, which isn't exactly a good piece of evidence. Also, it's more specific then is stated. Only 15-20% of *American riflemen* fired their *personal* weapons *at an exposed enemy soldier*. This makes the statistic a lot more understandable, because it excludes crew-served weapons (machine guns), and key weapons (flamethrowers).

While his numbers were initially accepted and frequently quoted, they've been called into question several times. One of the larger things I've seen pointed out in rebuttals of his statistics is that it fails to distinguish between soldiers who *can* fire, and shoulders who *should* fire. A medic has a sidearm. Should he be firing at an exposed soldier, or should he be doing his normal duties? What about squad leaders, more focused on directing the battle then taking shots themselves?

[This](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf) is an excellent breakdown of why his methods were called into question, and includes an interview by the man who accompanied him through his interviews in the Korean war (which came up with a 50% fire rate). Some sample issues with his work include that he didn't interview casualties, only unharmed men who were still ready for action, that he didn't take into account things like weapons jamming, and that his numbers were based more on guesses then anything else. It wasn't a proper survey even, but instead a group discussion he'd pull information out of.

Reply,cgoq6kj,22o24j,"Ah yes, Marshall's study on combat fire ratios. The answer is: no one knows. There's a lot of explosions and confusions during war, keep in mind 20% of all casualties in WWII was from friendly fire ^ 0 (over the years this decreased as our forces became more organized or alternatively the enemies after WWII we fought were less and less organized then the Axis). Many people have cried bullshit at his studies, his studies were poorly documented, were based on after action interviews, and said things like ""Brennan’s account also reinforces the contention of critics of Marshall’s use of statistics, who conclude that Marshall was unscientific in his methodology and that his figures about the percentage of troops firing their weapons were either sloppy, fabricated, or simply guesswork. ... Nevertheless, unlike the recollection of the Army
captain who accompanied Marshall in Europe in World War II that he could not
recall Marshall ever asking who had fired his weapon, Brennan does recall the
journalist occasionally asking that question directly in his interviews in Korea."" ^1

I would like to mention a scene in Maus, the comic book / biography in which the author's father is ordered to fire his weapon, so he blindly fires it, partly because he's unwilling to take another life (although later he does kill a German soldier). ^3 In a google search I just made, somewhere between 25,000 to 100,000 rounds were expended per kill in Vietnam. That is because of suppressive fire. But I must say that it's hard to figure out the motivations for suppressive fire, it could be caused by combat stress or opposing enemy suppressive fire causing soldiers to , or it could be a result of a psychological factor that results in people to avoid aiming directly at an enemy (few people want to kill another person).

I also would like to say it's pretty unlikely for soldiers to admit in front of their comrades that they didn't even attempt to kill an enemy. Unfortunately nothing is certain in war, maybe when we attach cameras to the guns of soldiers we could get a better glimpse, but even then... nothing is certain.


I apologize that this post falls a little short of the standards of this subreddit, but this question is probably better asked in r/military/ or r/asksocialscience/ .


On a final note, Marshall's statistics was part of the reason for the adoption of the M16, it was felt that automatic weapons would allow soldiers who typically don't fire their weapons to blind fire their weapons through suppressive fire.

What is important about Marshal's work is that it brings to light much more than just the firing rate. There are whole sections on command and training that have been accepted and incorporated into modern training. 

For Grossman, I feel like his point was a bit weak. Basing your work on already shaky research makes it hard to come to a clear and concise point. Linking violent video games to aggressive behaviour is popular and sells copies, but that might just be my biased interpretation of things.

Reply,cgoq924,22o24j,"Probably referring to S. L. A. Marshall's findings, reported in Men Against Fire and other places:

&gt;The thing is simply this, that out of an average 100 men along the line of fire during the period of an encounter, only 15 men on average would take any part with the weapons.  This was true whether the action was spread over a day, or two days or three...In the most aggressive infantry companies, under the most intense local pressure, the figure rarely rose above 25% of total strength from the opening to the close of an action.

And

&gt;It is therefore reasonable to believe that the average and healthy individual--the man who can endure the mental and physical stresses of combat--still has such an inner and usually unrealized resistance towards killing a fellow man that he will not of his own volition take life if it is possible to turn away from that responsibility...At the vital point he becomes a conscientious objector...

Marshall's conclusions have not gone unchallenged, and are still discussed today.  [Apparently his methods were not very rigorous or scientific](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/03autumn/chambers.pdf), and there's lots of reasons for a soldier to not fire his weapon, even in a close engagement with the enemy.  (Do keep in mind that the weapons of the time were powerful enough to make even a fleeting and momentary glimpse of the enemy a good opportunity for a kill.  These weren't firing lines 100 yards apart.  Even an earnest killer might not have abundant opportunities of actually shooting someone.)

Reply,cgoqevd,22o24j,"That claim is based on the books ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"", by David Grossman; and ""Men against Fire"", by SLA Marshall.

I'll get my bias out here - I think this idea is crap, and the basic reason is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there is no evidence to support that claim.

Marshall's work, wherein he makes the claim that 75% of soldiers do not fire on the enemy, was based on post-combat interviews with soldiers, but no record of any questions about the ratio of fire exists.

In fact, the only record of his interviews at all (besides his books), makes mention of soldiers firing weapons, but nothing whatsoever that could support a hard number of how many men fired or did not fire.

There is no evidence of statistical analysis based on his interviews, no records of questions about whether soldiers fired or not, no questions about ammunition consumption. There is no evidence from quartermasters about ammunition consumption, barrel wear, or any other secondary evidence.

So this number is one that Marshall may have arrived at honestly, but there is simply no evidence to support it.

If you're interested, Robert Engen wrote a very incisive article on the subject in the Canadian Military Journal, and wrote his Masters thesis on the subject.

Engen found (and has the evidence to prove) that - for Canadians, at the very least - did not have this problem. Based on primary sources (written post-combat interviews with Canadian officers), he found *exactly the opposite* of what Marshall and Grossman claim.

Canadian officers found that their forces fire was very effective, and, if anything, their men fired *too much*!

So - there's no evidence to support this claim, and there is primary source evidence that it is BS.

If you'd like to read Engen's article in the CMJ or his thesis, here they are:

http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/1081/1/Engen_Robert_C_200803_MA.pdf

In the interest of (a little) balance, Grossman makes a (in my opinion very feeble) defense of his work and Marshall's in the CMJ as well:

Reply,cgot99h,22o24j,"*Acts of War* by Richard Holmes also references Marshall's work and is in turn referenced by Grossman.  I think Holmes presents a far more rounded view of the infantry soldier's experience and does a much better job of analysing why soldiers fight (or not) and the effect that it has on them.  It is full of examples of counter-intuitive behaviour and emphasises that once battle is joined the situation is so chaotic that typical predictions of human behaviour do not hold true.  Who would have thought that a large number of Argentinian soldiers at Goose Green would have responded to bombardment by getting into their sleeping bags?

The major problems with this whole subject area is that there is not a continuous stream of armed actions which can be directly observed by psychologists and, in common with the majority of social research, it is impossible to control for the relevant variables:

&gt; ""Everyone stop!  OK, now I want Smoggins to stand up and let’s see if Gruber over there fires at him.""

Almost everything in this area is laced with bias.

Against this backdrop I see Marshall's and Grossman's works as important contributions to a poorly studied area in which no one can produce any definitive research.

Reply,dbst1wj,5l23au,"So, instead of investigating what actually happened here, you ignorantly asserted there was fraud in our state. Hating on California. If you wanted to know what the safeguards are, why didn't you just look it up? California is very open about it's process, you can even phone the office and ask them about it.

Reply,dbstulm,5l23au,"I find you're state's behavior in this election over the last year to be wholly offensive.  Californians have been almost singularly responsible for defending and almost installing an illegitimate criminal into the highest office in the world.  And continues to do so.  And yet your Hillary side seems to think it can take the higher moral ground.. that is very offensive to me.  It's as if you want to ignore 3 decades of history.

So if you need to retreat to your safespace because my post triggered you, no one is going to complain.

Also, I will investigate and I will make you eat your words.  If i""m wrong I will eat mine.  But you have to face the facts that if you had proof I was wrong you would post it.

Reply,e2bxdg5,8yktu5,"[Actual quote from President Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/full-text-theresa-may-trump-visit-transcript-718569):

&gt; I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit and I said I think Brexit would happen and it did happen.

President Trump [left for the UK on Friday 24th June](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (UK time), arrived in Scotland [some time later on Friday 24th June](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746272130992644096) - around 10am - and was [getting ready to open Turnberry](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746273889160957952) around 10.30am.

No matter how you spin it he didn't open Turnberry the day before Brexit.

The guy couldn't remember basic facts.

-------

Other gems from the press conference. The whole ""fake news"" for reporting what he said thing, saying ""We left [the Nato] meeting more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before"" - interesting use of ""wealthy"" there.

On meeting with President Putin:

&gt; We will talk about a number of things: Ukraine, Syria, the Middle East, nuclear proliferation. We are massively modernizing and fixing and buying and it’s just a devastating technology. It is a very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big and I’ll be talking about nuclear proliferation.

On Nato spending:

&gt; I say we pay 90 percent of the cost of NATO, which is really there for Europe much more than for us.

He can say that, but it isn't true. Based on [a couple](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/) of [sources](https://www.nato.int/cps/ie/natohq/topics_67655.htm) the US contributes 22% of Nato's common fund, and about 70% of Nato military spending.

On immigration, after some classic dog-whistle racism:

&gt;  It’s not good for Europe and it’s not good for our country. We have very bad immigration laws. We’re doing incredibly well considering we virtually don’t have immigration laws — I don’t even call them laws, you just walk across the border and then you’re tied in a lawsuit for five years.

On the UK-US special relationship:

&gt; I would give our relationship with the U.K. the highest level of special. Am I allowed to go higher than that? They are very special people, it’s a very special country and my mother was born in Scotland. As far as advice goes, I gave her a suggestion and I think maybe she found it too brutal. I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I can fully understand why she thought it might be tough — if they don’t get the right deal, she may choose to do what I suggested. It’s a disgrace how the EU has taken advantage of the U.S.

On Russia invading Ukraine:

&gt; President Obama failed very badly with Crimea — I wouldn’t have done that. He took it over during the Obama administration. We’ll have to see what happens ... I’m not bad at doing things. Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster. If I were president, he would not have taken over.

On Theresa May:

&gt;  She will do very well. She is a tough negotiator and a very smart and determined people.

On the Russia meeting:

&gt; Proliferation, to me, is the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. I used to talk nuclear with my uncle. It is the biggest problem the world has, so if we can do something to reduce them, maybe it’s a dream, but it’s a subject I will bring up with him. I was telling the PM that I’m not going in with high expectations. We have stupidity going on in the U.S. that makes it hard to do something with Russia.

Reply,e2busgu,8yktu5,"The confusion seems to be due to time zones.

Based on [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/746144027616120833) (assuming it is accurate) he left the US at roughly 2am on 24th June *UK time*, which would have been 6-9pm 23rd June *US time*. Direct commercial flights take 6-8 hours, so depending on how he travelled, he might have arrived in the UK just on 23rd June in the western parts of the US.

At a guess, President Trump's press office said he'd be flying to Scotland on Thursday 23rd (which is true), and that got repeated by the UK press by without checking for time zones, and also got turned from ""leaving on 23rd"" to ""arriving on 23rd"" by mistake.",None,comment

Reply,d0sut6h,49l01s,"&gt; Who do I believe, The Sun or Nick Clegg?

Most likely somewhere in between. Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.

After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").

That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.

So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.

http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6986518/Queen-hailed-as-a-backer-of-Brexit.html

&gt; THE Queen has been hailed as a backer of Brexit tonight after details emerged of an extraordinary alleged bust-up between her and Nick Clegg over Europe.

&gt; Her Majesty let rip at the then Deputy PM during a lunch at Windsor Castle, The Sun has been told.

&gt; The 89-year-old monarch firmly told passionate pro-EU Mr Clegg that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction.

&gt; Her stinging reprimand went on for “quite a while”, leaving other guests around the table stunned.

It'll be interesting to see how the Queen reacts, because if she denies backing Brexit it will show that she supports the EU. ",None,comment

Reply,d0sut6h,49l01s,"&gt; Who do I believe, The Sun or Nick Clegg?

Most likely somewhere in between. Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.

After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").

That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.

So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.

Reply,d0sph03,49l01s,"&gt; It'll be interesting to see how the Queen reacts, because if she denies backing Brexit it will show that she supports the EU. 

Seems to me like it's just a case of the Sun trying to goad some sort of response out of Buckingham Palace that they can call a statement of support for one side or the other. Looking through that article for the origin of the headline, we have this:

&gt; The account of the bombshell lunch during the last government - which a handful of other government ministers also attended - has been relayed to The Sun by a highly reliable source. 

It all rather depends on how much we trust the Sun to be telling the truth about its ""highly reliable source"". It's not exactly convincing, quite frankly. Before I'm prepared to ascribe a political position to such a famously political neutral figure, I'm going to need a lot more than a source without a name that comes with The Sun's word I can trust what I'm seeing.

&gt; A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. We would never comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims.""

Seems entirely reasonable.

The Sun are just trying to play the ludicrous justification that because Her Majesty made a very neutral statement in the run up to the Scottish referendum to the effect that voters should ""think very carefully"", that means that 

&gt;It is now beyond doubt that she made a very careful intervention in the Scottish independence referendum to back a vote for the union. 

and that therefore

&gt;If she has a view on something as big as Brexit, don’t voters have a right to know what it is?

In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party.

Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury.

For example the US are having a big debate at the moment to decide their new leader. There are a ton of smaller state elections to work out the party nominees and then there will be a national election to work out who the new president is. But in the EU we don't have that. We're just told Junker is the president as voted for by the leaders of each nation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission#Appointment

Well why should I trust Cameron to pick the right person? Also why do leaders of nations with a population of a few million get the same say as leaders of nations with a population of over 50 million?

Surely something as important as who our president is should be something that the entirety of the EU population should get a say in? And this is something that should have bene built in right at the start, not something that we are aspirationally moving towards.

What are your thoughts on this?",None,comment
Reply,d0t6hfd,49l01s,"Did you vote for Cameron to become Prime Minister? No, you voted for an MP and he was selected by MPs.

This is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too. It should be someone appointed by and who commands a majority of the EU parliament, this is how many countries select their leader and I have no problem with that. Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.

Also don't forget, everything the EU tries to pass MUST be approved by EU parliament which has proportional representation and Britain due to its population has a gigantic number of MEPs representing it. ",None,comment
Reply,d0u2vle,49l01s,"And that would be fine if Junker were the leader of the largest party of MEPs and campaigned as their leader during the election. That would be transparency.

Cameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability. I doubt the US population would be happy with their president being selected by all the state governors under the argument that any law has to be passed by the House anyway.

This is not even close to democratic. FPTP for all its flaws at least is an election. Why are you supporting a system that diminishes the power of voters?",None,comment
Reply,d0u5ske,49l01s,"Well the US president is selected by the electoral college who do have the power to ignore the popular vote but obviously that is not really relevant.

The EU is trying to make the election of the president more transparent. Bizarrely, it's the people who argue that the EU needs reform such as Cameron who oppose such changes. 

Also I support the EU because as an Irish citizen, I have seen directly the good it has done for my country. I also see real attempts to make the system fairer and more democratic through documents like the Lisbon treaty.",None,comment

However, these conventions are also not able to stand in a court or enforceable in anyway essentially acting as agreements.

Reply,d0sut6h,49l01s,"&gt; Who do I believe, The Sun or Nick Clegg?

Most likely somewhere in between. Reading between the lines I imagine a conversation did happen at some lunch where she said something negative about the EU to Nick Clegg.

After the lunch someone else at the table (possibly a senior Conservative figure?) probably told the story on to one of their colleagues, perhaps over-dramatising it a bit, as a little jab at Clegg (along the lines of ""the Queen had a rant at him over the EU, it was a bit surprising"").

That person (if I had to guess, probably someone close to Boris Johnson, if not him) is now supporting ""Leave"" and has therefore leaked what they remembered of it to someone at The Sun (directly or indirectly), who in turn have put their own spin on things.

So Clegg probably can't deny it completely as the conversation may have happened - but the Sun's spin (that she supports Brexit and that she 'let rip' at him and so on) may be ""nonsense"" and didn't happen.

Reply,d0sxkjm,49l01s,"Funnily enough, I'm writing about consequences that are certainties at the moment. While I believe there will be numerous near-certainties and likely occurrences, these are purely things that will happen. Copying and pasting ruins the formatting, so here's a short sample:

- The UK will leave all EU treaties after 2 years from a “No” vote unless. For this period the UK will be subject to all the laws, but have no vote on them. This will be avoided if:
- A qualified majority of remaining member states and a majority of the European Parliament agree and ratify on a settlement.
- All 27 remaining member states agree and ratify an extension of this.
- Trade deals alone take 5-10 years or more. Negotiating anything beyond this (such as EEA membership or similar) would take a similar amount of time. More complex deals would logically take longer.
- While these timescales cannot be “known”, a faster negotiation would be record-breaking. 
- Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.
- A shorter example is that of the EEA; it took from 1989 to 1994
- 12.6% of UK GDP is linked to exports to the EU, while only 3.1% of other EU member states GDP is linked to exports to the UK. Any proposition that that “they need us more than we need them” and as such the EU will be desperate to give the UK a special deal in rapid time for economic reasons doesn’t hold up.
- The simplest free trade deal would be EEA membership. This entails:
- Large membership fees
- Freedom of movement
- Following a vast majority of the laws
- All three of these are cited by anti-EU people as reasons to leave in the first place, so I personally doubt this would be seen as a better situation.

In fairness I wish this was the way all corporate lobbying operated.

Petition your employees who then petition government and vote in their own interests (while taking on board the company's views).

Corporate political donations could work in a similar way.    

The amount of money a company was planning on donating gets divided up and each employee gets a 'campaign voucher' that they are free to give to any political party of their choosing. 

The company then petitions their employees on who they'd prefer the donations go to, why that party is better for the company and its employees, etc. And how the policies of that party will enable the company to grow, wages to rise, etc.

Ultimately though the donations would be made anonymously by employees entirely at their own discretion after weighing their employer's arguments against their own views.

This is how the appointment of the EU president is supposed to work too. It should be someone appointed by and who commands a majority of the EU parliament, this is how many countries select their leader and I have no problem with that. Junker is the first time those requirements were enforced. Cameron trying to block Junker was actually an attempt to deny the people of Europe a say in who was president.

- Britain hasn’t negotiated a trade deal for 40 years. We would need time to build up the resources and expertise for negotiation and dealing with trade defence cases.

Reply,d0spd4e,49l01s,"Clegg was an MEP, his group in the EP is led by Guy Verhofstadt who said the EU constitutional treaty was a ""capstone of a United States of Europe"". The Lisbon treaty (an undemocratic re-write of the constitution that the Queen was apparently concerned about as well) passed the same powers to the EU, and gave it a foreign minister, which puts it heavily on a path to acquire an army to back up its foreign policy. There are loads of federalists in Brussels calling for an EU army anyway, and Clegg's party group mates are among them. Yet Clegg to a UK audience says Farage is a barking mad conspiracy theorist for bringing up an EU army. Dishonest in the extreme.  

Both here and in the other place lib dems are massively overrepresented compared to the population so criticising Clegg always gets downvotes but I simply don't care, he's one of the most dishonest politicians in modern politics. I am sick of the federal question being avoided by these people. No other trade group has a foreign minister and serious proposals for an army, it's a farce to see people pretend this is all about trade, it's a federation.",None,comment

Cameron trying to stop it is as much of a problem as any of the other leaders trying to support it. The point is that these decisions are taken far away from the electorate with zero accountability.

In the UK, The Crown is the only real constraint on parliamentary tyranny and on tyranny of the majority. The Crown prevents a prime minister from declaring themselves Fuhrer after purging another party.

Of course democracy matters, but constitutionalism, rule of law, civil liberties, and a system of checks and balances matter more. If the armed forces sided against The Crown, they would be guilty of perjury. Republicans in Parliament are already guilty of perjury.

So it's entirely possible that if you accounted for differential turnout according to both age and social class, you'd get a different result, and find that uniform turnout would have changed the results (ie voters represented a skewed sample of the electorate).

Yes, for a time, until they become part of a voting block that votes in greater numbers in which case their needs will be better served.

As sustainable as any Ponzi scheme.

Reply,dc5n87i,5mkmg1,"The linked article does have an element of truth in it, in that the statistic is often stated incorrectly. The [Doran (2009) study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/eost2009EO03/epdf) found that 97% of those respondents with the greatest level of expertise in climate science agreed that ""human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures.""  The NaturalNews article seems to suggest that these respondents were cherry-picked to produce the desired result, but they represented those ""who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change."" This is naturally going to be a much smaller subset of scientists, but it includes those whose knowledge and expertise is arguably most relevant.

This result is often shorthanded in public discourse to ""97% of scientists agree,"" but that's not an issue of scientific fraud.  The scientists explained it fully in their publication.

It's also relevant (but not addressed in the NaturalNews article) that several independent studies have been done using different methods, and reached very similar conclusions. [This skepticalscience.com article](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm) provides a good overview.

",None,comment
Reply,dc49ttw,5mkmg1,"Lol natural news.

On a serious note, even if the 97% consensus is ""bunk"" the science is not.

Edit: I'm going to expand on this a little more and explain why the science is not bunk:

Firstly, we know that CO2 traps heat, it is a greenhouse gas just like methane and water vapour. The way these molecules trap heat is easy: they absorb the radiation, keep it then radiate it out in all directions. Other molecules then pick up this radiated heat and the cycles continues.

The way this becomes a problem is due to positive feedback, which is a way of saying ""something causes itself"". Heating the atmosphere has another effect, heating up air allows for it to absorb more water vapour and since water vapour is a GHG, yeah you're seeing where this is going. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more GHG's it can absorb and so on.

Now where deniers get this wrong is the whole state of the CO2. Yes plants and trees absorb CO2, the issue is that this cycle (aptly named the Carbon Cycle) was in equalibium, the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere was equal to the amount leaving. Now it is not equal, the amount entering the atmosphere is far more than the total biomass can absorb and thus a net increase.

I hope this clears up certain myths because the science of climate change is really not difficult to understand.

First thing I noticed was that it talks about one survey, when multiple have been conducted showing similar percentages, the wikipedia article you linked talks about Harris Interactive's survey of 489 randomly selected scientists, the 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters that looked at 11,944 abstracts - I believe there have been others.

No because it doesn't prove anything, nor is that an accurate description of what happened, nor should this (sadly it is) used to describe how correct anthropomorphic climate change is.

Reply,dkforfa,6o9ozz,"You are on the right track. A few additional points : 

* The bulk of the mass (90% or more of total mass!) that you lift out of the gravity well, is in fact the fuel that you are using to lift you out of the gravity well. This is why rockets use stages, so they can abandon the empty tanks as soon as they are empty. 
* * See the fuel paradox section of this article https://medium.com/@landingattempts/why-do-rockets-use-so-much-fuel-118486244aba
* As you said, the moon's gravity is much weaker, and wouldn't take that much to escape (1/6 of the cost of lifting that same mass from earth. And additionally, we were lifting much less mass from the moon than we lifted from earth)
* *  Added to that, for the actual moon landing, we only took enough fuel to get back into moon-orbit. All the rest of the fuel stayed in orbit around the moon for the trip back to earth.
* * all the abandoned rocket stages on earth, all the fuel that had already been spent, the command module in moon orbit, the parts of the Lunar Module we left on the moon, the rover, etc was all mass we didn't have to move around the second time, making the fuel requirements cheaper.
* The entire moon journey was in orbit around the earth. It took relatively little fuel to push us towards the moon, and then come back. Notably, had we missed the moon, we would have come back to earth automatically, without expending further fuel (although perhaps the astronauts would have run out of air first)
* * This was used for practical effect in Apollo 13 where they just did a trip around the moon and came back, because if they didn't actually have enough fuel to ""turn around"" at the time that the accident happened
* * This type of logic was a major plot point in the book version of the Martian
* During the trip to/from , spending additional fuel just gets you there faster, but every bit of fuel you spend speeding you up, you might also have to spend slowing you down again (absent using the gravity well for that purpose) - so they minimize the amount of fuel the actually use for the trip, and save it mostly for emergencies and course corrections. If it takes you 30 days, or 35 days probably isn't a big deal as long as you planned for it, and the additional cost/weight of the fuel to do it in 5 days less is prohibitive). - So they figure out the acceptable mission length, and take enough fuel for that to work out. ",None,comment
Reply,dkfp7x9,6o9ozz,"Thanks so much for your answer! If you have knowledge of the 'ratio' of the fuel necessary to get to the moon (i.e. get out of the earth's gravity well) vs. the fuel needed to get a much smaller vehicle in and out of the moon-orbit and then back into the earth-orbit that takes it home, that would be very helpful :)

Thanks for giving me further things to google though!",None,comment
Reply,dkfq5c6,6o9ozz,"This image gives you quite a bit of the info basically the first and second stages are used entirely to get into earth orbit, and the third stage is for the moon and back : 

S1 : ~500k Gallons
S2 : ~300k G
s3 : ~80k G
 
Probably unaccounted for here is the fuel to lift off from the moon, which was in separate tanks for the lunar module, and would not be that much due to the low gravity of the moon, and the much lower amount of mass being lifted.

Reply,d1rfaf8,4dfdvo,"Its easiest to debunk by reading the actual article.

The website refers to this study: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell.  The paragraph on fluoride reads: ""A meta-analysis of 27 cross-sectional studies of children exposed to fluoride in drinking water, mainly from China, suggests an average IQ decrement of about seven points in children exposed to raised fluoride concentrations.44 Confounding from other substances seemed unlikely in most of these studies. Further characterisation of the dose–response association would be desirable."" 

If you click on the reference 44, it takes you to the PubMed citation for the source of that meta-analysis, and at the bottom of that citation is an exchange between skeptics and the authors (again, more links).  Here is selected text from the skeptics (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621182/):""Even if we ignore the weaknesses of the study (Choi et al. 2012), including a lack of individual-level information and the high probability of confounding because the authors did not adjust for covariates, a difference of 0.4 in mean IQ is clinically negligible (Jeckel et al. 2007; Rothman et al. 2008; Szklo and Nieto 2007) even though it was statistically significant.""

So the article on the website makes a big deal about 1 paragraph in a review article (Level 5 evidence, by the way), which refers to a meta-analysis (Level 1 evidence). The biggest issue with the meta-analysis is really that it found a 0.4-point drop in IQ, which as the skeptics point out, is clinically negligible even if it is statistically significant.

TL:DR: The Lancet did not declare fluoride a neurotoxin, they published an opinion piece where the authors noted a potential link between fluoride exposure and IQ (not dyslexia and ADHD). The data supporting this link suggest a statistically significant, but clinical unimportant, effect.  Debunked.",None,comment

Reply,d23k9ry,4dfdvo,"One thing ""scare articles"" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes remove fluoride instead of adding it. 

The whole thing came about as a result of a condition called ""texas teeth"".  Folks in some areas developed unsightly brown stains on their teeth, but those same stained chompers showed marked decreases in decay.  The cause was the naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the water.  Research was done to find a happy medium between strong teeth and brown ones, and a sort of national standard was picked.  So in some spots the water treatment includes *removing it* instead of adding it.  Shutting down all fluoridation treatment would also shut down this protection.

I'm sure in high enough doses you could hurt yourself with fluoride.  At high enough doses you can hurt yourself with water.  However even if you're drinking water from an unregulated well in an area with high natural fluoride in it you're unlikely to be harmed by it.

My mother was a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII when fluoride simply wasn't available.  My aunt lost all her teeth as a teenager.  My mother kept hers but doesn't have one without serious dental work in it.  Mine aren't perfect but a LONG way from either of those scenarios.  My childhood was soaked in fluoride, both from school ""treatment"" programs and at home in the form of toothpastes.

Reply,cq6dipq,31xv6u,"&gt;However, scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages. They only uncover dead dinosaurs (i.e., their bones), and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are. The idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists’ story about the past. No scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age. In fact, there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old

This is simply not true. The main way scientists can date fossils they find is by referring to the [geological strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) in which the fossils were found. The only working explanation for the existence of strata is that they were laid down over millions of years (before Darwin, it was actually geologists who first questioned the age of the Earth and the biblical creation myth.) By looking at which stratum a fossil was found in, you can get an idea, to the nearest million years or so, when the fossil was formed.

You can also use radioactive decay to date certain types of rock found in the same stratum. Carbon dating isn't much good for dinosaur fossils, as it can only date objects younger than about 50,000 years, but by looking at the decay of elements with longer half-lives like uranium, you can determine when certain (volcanic) strata were laid down. If you find a fossil above a stratum you know is 80 million years old, and below a stratum you know is 60 million years old, that fossil must be between 60 and 80 million years old.

Reply,cq6do3d,31xv6u,"&gt;This would mean, of course, that there would have been millions of creatures during that time that would be “in between,” as amphibians evolved into reptiles. Evidence of these “transitional forms,” as they are called, should be abundant. 

Firstly, no scientist expects fossil evidence to be ""abundant."" [Fossilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Fossilization_processes) is something which happens extremely rarely. An organism has to die in quite specific circumstances in order to end up as a fossil, and the vast majority of plants and animals will just decay into nothing. It's only because of the sheer age of the world and the number of organisms that have lived and died that we are able to find so many fossils. But the fossil record is by it's nature incomplete. 

Secondly, there are plenty of examples of transitional fossils. However, these are also examples of unique species. Any organism discovered which is sufficiently different from other known organisms gets classified as a new species. If we know about Species A and Species C, and we believe Species C to be a descendant of Species A, then we might look for a species which is an ancestor of Species C *and* a descendant of Species A, which we'll call Species B. B would be a ""transitional form"" between A and C. However, the standard response of creationists is then to ask ""Where's the transitional form between A and B?""

Reply,cq6fj7f,31xv6u,"The others have given good answers, and I would like to add http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis to the mix.

But over and above that, a little rational thought might be an interesting place to work from. Consider the following train of thought:

1) There are a hell of a lot of people involved in the sciences. Everything from medical research to physics to geology to orbital mechanics to engineering and materials, etc.

2) A subset of these people are involved in Paleontology, but relevantly their work _overlaps_ with these other sciences. Radiometric dating overlaps with nuclear physics. Strata dating overlaps with geology. Our understanding of fossilisation comes from our understandings of chemistry and biology.

3) All of these other disciplines are tested by the fact that we _use_ them. We use geology to find oils and minerals and predict the weather and choose where to build huge buildings. We use biology and chemistry in a huge range of applications, from chemical engineering to antibiotics to heart transplants to modern crop farming. We have nuclear reactors that have been churning out predicable power for decades, and satellites serving our communications, and millions of aeroplanes safely running about the skies. We have cellphones.

4) All of the above are using exactly the same understandings about the world that paleontologists use to date dinosaur bones and evolutionary scientists use to understand the development of modern species. It's all the same mechanics, just a slightly different application. To say that the knowledge is somehow wrong is like saying that a man who is an excellent driver of a four-door sedan can in no way know _anything_ about driving a hatchback.

So, this leads us to one of three conclusions. Either...

a) We're somehow wrong about how everything works, and all the stuff we've managed to do is sheer luck that it works, despite our misunderstanding.

b) It's all a giant 'evolutionist' conspiracy, one that would have to involve so many people that it would be almost a majority of the population (at least, the population with power and influence). The point of such a conspiracy would be unclear, since I can't see a real reward.

c) The bible literalists are wrong.

So that should give OP enough numbers to do some back of the envelope calculations of he really wanted to answer that question, but I don't think that's what he wanted to know. I think you're giving an over-literal interpretation of his words, without taking into account what he likely meant to say.

Also even if that is indeed what he meant, it's kinda a silly thing to ask. We have the co2 records going back millions of years, from measuring  trapped air bubbles in stone. We've seen co2 get really high, then get lower as plants sequestered it as hydrocarbons. It's all over the place. So it isn't really relevant to ask what the co2 output of a volcano is, because it never really had enough of an impact historically to really be a relevant factor. I.

Fukushima is still in the clean-up process. There are still issues with radiation leakages - now whilst *any* radiation leak is considered serious, technically speaking it is only affecting a small area, and should only concern e.g. locals and fishermen

The article in question is highly dubious and not to be trusted.

EPA spokesmen and US experts have said there is nothing to worry about from a US point of view.

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. 

Some men.

A minority of men.

A sub-population of men.

Certain kinds of men.

Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.

But not all men. 

You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. 

And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. 

This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.",None,comment

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of 
Undocumented Immigrants"" Not immigrants..

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

&gt; Nonetheless, results show that undocumented immigrants 
generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice 
system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of 
criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused 
consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime 
reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented 
immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., 
intensified policing), or a combination of factors.

Reply,dyya382,8j9s33,"&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.

Reply,dyya382,8j9s33,"&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. 

Some men.

A minority of men.

A sub-population of men.

Certain kinds of men.

Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.

But not all men. 

You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. 

And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. 

This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.",None,comment

Reply,dz08rnx,8j9s33,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. 

In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: 

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: 

&gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""

I don't trust their data because I found factual errors in it already. They claim 21.9% of Money Laundering/Racketeering convictions were for non-citizens, but the USSC data shows 33.8% for Money Laundering and 11.9% for Racketeering (separate categories) and I can't see how they get 21.9% from that. Their numbers for sex offenses and homicides don't match up either. The numbers for auto theft are double what USSC has listed. Find a better, less biased source that isn't associated with white nationalists.

&gt; Making it easier or harder to immigrate legally has nothing to do with how someone feels about illegals, it has to do wh the economic impact that comes with adding to a population.

The right uses their supposed hatred of illegals as an cover for their general xenophobia. They want to keep *everyone* out, so they harp on illegal immigration to keep people distracted while they also cut back on legal immigration. The fact of the matter is that we *need* the millions of extra workers that legal and illegal immigration provides to keep our economy running.

&gt;  
&gt;•  44 percent of Latinos surveyed reported they are less likely to contact police officers if they have been the victim of a crime because they fear that police officers will use this interaction as an opportunity to inquire into their immigration status or that of people they know.

&gt;•  45 percent of Latinos stated that they are less likely to voluntarily offer information about crimes, and 45 percent are less likely to report a crime because they are afraid the police will ask them or people they know about their immigration status.

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

Reply,dyyh19s,8j9s33,"Panama is used as a major drug trafficking *port* and gets a hands-off on the worst of the violence, whereas Mexico is so large and populated that its status as a border country doesn't matter because that's where so many of the producers and their rich overlords are living. Panama is used as the clean business front. You also can't ignore the *positive* involvement of the US in Panama (overseeing the canal); we have an obvious economic interest in Panama *not* being a terrifying place because it would shit all over our trade, whereas the security of Mexico or Colombia is less of a concern for us. 


First, the way we profited by drug countries was *through* the creation and sale of drugs. Then, when those drugs are sold in the US, we profit by criminalizing them and filling the prisons with cheap labor, with the secondary ""benefit"" of disproportionately targetting people of color and other undesirables; a fine bonus for the racists in charge of policy. Fear of violence increases the production and sale of arms, both small (for the protection of the average citizen) and military-grade (in case we need another intervention). We can also sell weapons to those countries now facing the drug violence we basically bankrolled, leading to more profit. That fear also drives citizens here to vote for the political party viewed as ""tougher"" on crime, which does not create any incentive for said party to *actually* help solve the problem so long as they can keep up appearances alone.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done.

Reply,dyyu4t6,8j9s33,"You are simply incorrect, my friend.

Read the ABSTRACT in both journals, they lay out precisely what the study is all about.

""Results show that, compared with second-generation and native-born youth, first-generation youth tend to have more positive views toward the law, less cynical attitudes toward the legal system, and report more social costs associated with punishment.""

""Mounting evidence reveals that foreign-born, first generation immigrants have significantly lower levels of criminal involvement compared to their US-born, second and third-plus generation peers.""

They are based on the same Alex R. Piquero who is mentioned in OP's link.

Reply,dz02b9f,8j9s33,"I read them. Your first quote describes the feelings and opinions that first generation youth have toward the legal system \(it states nothing about actual crime rate\). Your second quote is taken from the 'Objective' section of the research article \(which serves to provide context for the current research being performed\), here the author is stating a claim, in this case he is citing his own research in the 2014 study, this is not the conclusion statement of the research article.  All these studies were of youth who had already committed a crime, so more of a study in recidivism, not crime rate across whole populations.

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] ",None,comment
Reply,dz08rnx,8j9s33,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. 

In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: 

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: 

&gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""

So what exactly is wrong with their methodology again?

There is NO OTHER WAY to determine if someone UNDOCUMENTED has been arrested without first asking.",None,comment

Because the current administration is making legal immigration more difficult. The requirements for several of the working visa programs have changed significantly, and the ban-that-isn't-about-Muslims-but-totally-is-about-Muslims makes people not want to come here for fear of getting turned away at last minute. Many people with green cards and visas were caught up in the travel ban. There was a reason that several states sued to overturn the ban, and it's not because they love illegal immigrants.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten.

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of 
Undocumented Immigrants"" Not immigrants..

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

&gt; Nonetheless, results show that undocumented immigrants 
generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice 
system. Divergence in the pattern of results contingent upon the measure of 
criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused 
consideration to disentangle whether the difference is due to: systematic crime 
reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting of crime among undocumented 
immigrants), differential treatment in the criminal justice system (e.g., 
intensified policing), or a combination of factors.

Really?

OK: thought experiment:

&gt;Not all Immigrants.

&gt;It’s the phrase we hear time and time again, albeit in a very narrow set of circumstances. It’s never used, for example, when immigrant commentators opine on how immigrants are better cooks than locals, or immigrants are great at dancing.

&gt;*insert your own tired stereotype here*.

&gt;No, for some reason, those that screech #NotAllImmigrants! never seem to take issue with those such generalisations or sweeping statements.

&gt;But when locals talk about sexual violence and harassment, as they have done in their droves since the influx of migrants and allegations of sexual assault in Cologne came to light, you can bet your bottom dollar that immigrants will queue up to take issue with it.

&gt;Here’s how it usually goes:

&gt;Local: I’ve been shouted at in the street, groped in nightclubs, assaulted on the tube and was raped by an Arab.

&gt;Immigrant: Actually, I think it’s important to make clear that not all immigrants are like this. Most immigrants would never behave in such a terrible way. I certainly wouldn’t. Isn’t it a bit racist to tar all immigrants with the same brush?

&gt;Well, actually…

&gt; The #NotAllImmigrants brigade don’t sincerely think that locals talking about the violence we’ve been subjected to at the hands of immigrants are under the impression that every single immigrant on the planet has behaved in a similar way.

&gt;That would be, well, a bit silly.

&gt; If nearly every local you know has faced sexual violence or harassment in one form or another throughout her life, then us asking why ‘’immigrants’’ continue to perpetuate this culture, shouldn’t be controversial.

&gt; Yes, we KNOW that not every single immigrant is responsible. Yes, we KNOW that you would never do that; and you’ve reminded us enough, thanks.

&gt; So #NotAllImmigrants doesn’t clarify anything. It doesn’t add to the discussion or develop it in any way. All it does is derail and dismiss the lived experiences of locals And what the immigrants who leap to remind us that ‘’not all immigrants are like that’’, are actually saying is, ‘’I’m not like that.’’ Or to put it another way, they are letting locals know that discussing racism makes them uncomfortable, and they’d like to be absolved of any blame before they will let the locals continue.

&gt; Locals undertook massive amounts of emotional labour and relived personal trauma in sharing their stories of sexual violence on #MeToo. To ask us to hand out cookies and ‘Well Done For Not Raping Anybody’ badges to immigrants who rush to tell us #NotAllImmigrants, is unreasonable at best, and insulting at worst.

&gt; If you are an immigrant and don’t recognise yourself in the behaviour described by locals recently, then great. Our discussion of it shouldn’t offend you, or put you on edge. The immigrants who are behaving like allies in this are the ones that are amplifying local’s voices, examining their own behaviour, and not drowning out our conversations in search of praise or validation.

I can continue, if you want. Reads like an alt-right piece of propaganda.

**You. Are. Using. The. Exact. Same. Logic. And. Reasoning.**

And it's fundamentally flawed. The reason people say #NotAllMen is because it is inherently hurtful to even assume that a wide-range of the male population is part of this. We aren't. We aren't the assholes who grope you. We aren't the assholes who rape you. I'm not saying that in search of validation, as the article states that I am, but because it flat out slanderous, and degrading.

My very identity as a man is being associated with something that it just isn't. 

And as the alt-right uses these rhetorical tools against immigrants, brown people, Muslims, blacks, whatever the fuck, so you are using these **exact same rhetorical tools** to attack men, and then you hide behind the ""oh, but we don't **really** mean all men.""

Change the way you talk about the issue, and all is forgotten. 

Some men.

A minority of men.

A sub-population of men.

Certain kinds of men.

Whatever the fuck you want as a pre-fix men.

But not all men. 

You're turning via your use of language individuals, lots of individuals, into a monolith, something that you'd never accept for any other group. 

And on a side-note: the ""lived experiences"" part is worth nothing. It's about stats. Stats allow us to make effective changes and policy. And the stats are clear: many women suffer from sexual harassment, assault or rape, and we need to do something about that. But I don't care about ""lived experiences"", because they are inherently subjective and tainted in bias. We all fall prey to bias.

Alt-righters have their world view warped by their bias to elevate their whiteness to a position of superiority. Their lived experiences have taught them that all black people are criminals and dangerous thugs.

Lived experiences are never a good argument when formulating policy.

I won't throw out lived experiences when talking to individuals, of course. I'll listen. I'll be as supportive as I can. But I need grand-scale statistical data to talk about what needs to be done. 

This is exactly what I was referring to. The exact same logic is used by certain feminists to justify rhetorically putting all men in the same basket. And we not only don't deserve it, I, personally, will defend my character and identity, which is under attack when AllMen is used.",None,comment

Reply,dyya382,8j9s33,"&gt;You're saying you've made a judgement call that weed smokers aren't criminals, but that illegal immigrants are. 

Quit twisting what I wrote.  Anyone who smokes weed in a state where that practice is illegal is indeed engaging in criminal behavior.  My point was that I can see a justification for legalizing weed, but can not justify condoning illegal immigration or pursuing another illegal immigrant amnesty. Why?  There's no sound basis for doing so on behalf of illegal immigrants.  As for the moral and ethical implications involved, the federal government is obligated to put the interests of the country and U.S. citizens ahead of the self-serving desires of illegal immigrants. This is perfectly ethical and moral to do so since the responsibility to provide the illegal immigrants community's needs rest with their home countries and governments.

&gt;We don't convict people based on popular opinion, it's why we have courts, it's why we despise the idea of lynchings.

As I've already told you, this judgment call was conducted as objectively as it could be and without the emotional hysteria you are employing on the matter.  Your approach to illegal immigration would get wrecked in a court of law while my approach would hold up.  Case in point, your hysterical and emotionally charged reference to lynchings.  Pull that crap in a court of law and the presiding judge would slap you down for going there.

&gt;I don't agree with illegal immigration, but I also don't call those millions of people 'criminals'...

Why not?  It's what they willingly chose to be in life...outlaws.  Would you allow a misguided sense of political correctness keep you from calling a murderer, thief, embezzler, or con man a criminal too?  That defies logic and reason.

Do you know what actually caused millions of illegal immigrants to flee from Mexico to the U.S.?  Neoliberal economic reforms by Mexican politicians, specifically the push for privatization to  benefit a select few from NAFTA.  Care to guess where U.S. manufacturing and the jobs they once provided went shortly thereafter?  Mexico.

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] ",None,comment
Reply,dz08rnx,8j9s33,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. 

In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: 

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: 

&gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""

Bias: Extreme Right, Hate Group

Notes: The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a non-profit research organization “that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views.” It was started as a spin-off from John Tanton’s Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in 1985. Reports published by the CIS have been widely deemed misleading and riddled with basic errors by scholars on immigration; think tanks from across the ideological and political spectrum; media of all stripes; several leading nonpartisan immigration-research organizations; and by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The organization has also drawn criticism for its financial and intellectual ties to extremist racists. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 connecting CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and showing he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation (SPLC). Bottom line, this is a hate group. (2/8/2017)

http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/mar/22/center-immigration-studies-hate-group-southern-pov/

Speaking from an outside perspective (UK)The SPLC has done it's due dilligence in this matter, from the politifact link alone I would agree with their sentiment.

Your problem is that you are ignoring the fact that conservwtive views
Are being espoused by the alt-right and neo-nazi/KKK crowd, after all david duke endorsed trump, the alt-right and tge neo-nazis and the KKK follow a conservative ideology and believe that conservative policy will bring about their version of the U.S (the 1850's social mess, pre suffrage or civil rights movement or a white ethnostate, with P.O.C and minorites expelled or enslaved).

If you don't want them coopting your platform, chsnge your platform how hard is it to not want to treat women, P.O.C and minorities like shit? You have neo-nazis running for office in the conservative party (GOP, illinois, california, minnesota/michigan). The current GOP platform gives a voice to these types of hate and extreme views, call your rep, ask to denounce them at least, put some fucking effort in.

First of all, the study was titled, ""Investigating the Offending Histories of

Secondly, the study used self reporting to collect it's data. And the self reporting data diverged from the statistics.

generally report the lowest rate of offending prior to and following their first 
arrest. Yet despite offending less, undocumented immigrants are more likely to 
be re-arrested in the three-years following their initial contact with the justice

criminal behavior – self-report or official arrest – warrants focused

You are most definitely engaging in legalistic hairsplitting with that argument.  It is both disingenuous and fraudulent.  Crime and criminals are defined by law violations. Your argument rests solely on the penalties that result from that law-breaking while ignoring the law violation entirely.  That's what makes it so disingenuous.",None,comment

First, consistent with previous research, self\-reported offending prior to engagement with the justice system \(i.e., first arrest\) is relatively and consistently low for immigrants generally and for undocumented immigrants specifically compared to their US\-born peers. \[immigrants and undocumented immigrants self reported that they committed fewer crimes compared to whites in their initial interviews, whoa guess we'll take their word on that; not like there isn't rampant evidence that victims in immigrants neighborhoods are less likely to go to the cops \(fewer victims come forward, fewer arrests made\); see my previous posts in another parent thread\] 

Second, compared to their documented immigrant and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants continue to report low levels of offending in the three\-years following first arrest. \[undocumented immigrants in the follow up interviews self\-reported that they are committing fewer crimes; of course they would, they fear deportation\] 

Third, and in contrast to the findings for self\-reported offending, undocumented immigrants are more likely to be re\-arrested and are re\-arrested more in the three\-years following their first arrest. Differences in the risk of re\-arrest appear to be most pronounced immediately following their first arrest. \[hang on, now the study is looking at actual arrests, which reveal undocumented immigrants were lying in their interviews, maybe the self\-reported evidence isn't so robust?\] ",None,comment
Reply,dz08rnx,8j9s33,"Nothing about ""feelings and opinions"" in the ABSTRACT. Not sure why you keep hammering that.

You are implying these supposed thoughts and feelings. 

In fact, i'm not quite sure why asking undocumented immigrants if they've been arrested counts as ""thoughts and feelings"", and why it is *bad* to ask undocumented immigrants about their past.

To reiterate, the premise of your argument, ie ""this is all just a bunch of thoughts and feelings"", in reality, are researchers asking specific questions about their experiences with criminal behavior etc.

That is actually a valid approach in determining if someone has been arrested, you know, by simply asking them if they've been arrested or involved in criminal behavior.

Not only do they ask fact\-based questions, researchers also do what is called ""cross referencing"", in that they look up judicial records to VERIFY what they've been told.

In the link you posted, this is an excerpt from the ABSTRACT: 

&gt;""Results suggest that, as compared to documented immigrants and US\-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest""

Another excerpt from the CONCLUSION: 

&gt;""Justification for heightened immigration enforcement and the criminalization of immigration law is based on the assertion that undocumented immigrants represent a distinctly dangerous class. With this research, we **add to the limited knowledge base** and **investigate crime** among those lacking legal US residency **by assessing patterns of offending longitudinally, both prior to and following first arrest, using self\-reported offending and officially recorded arrest measures.**""

People who bake with salt don't general want added iodine because it can impart an off flavor when baked. Same for people who want to do brines. And so on. 

 Never the less, 90% of the salt sold is the cheap table salt variety which does contain iodine. The number of products does not tell you what people buy. There is only one cheapest brand of anything, and yet most people will buy that. We have options to buy both easily because there are good reasons to buy both. That is a good thing. 

In general, the more choices you have the better. If the government starts a smear campaign against iodized salt, sure.

Something for people to remember - Iodine evaporates and you are left with iodine-less salt if you leave the salt packet unsealed/open.

Iodine does not evaporate from iodized salt. It is not simply liquid iodine doused on salt. Iodine is a basic element and it has various forms. Iodized salt has a small amount of iodine *in-salt-form* added to the regular salt.

Don't  Expect the government to take care of you and look out for your best interest.  they are only interested in money  your health and safety is the least of their concerns. 

You must take it upon yourself to eat correctly and figure out what is safe for you to use. 

walk in any major grocery store and take a look around at the people shopping there.  Something is off the rails that many large people in the same place use to be a spectacle and not the norm.  

Organic food is worth the effort and or the price. there are a few foods that will give you enough iodine. dried seaweed has the highest amount .  Things like Eggs and Cod also have iodine but not as much. 

only cook in cast iron  and store items in unleaded glass containers.
Never use plastic for anything that you consume. 

hygiene items are a major cause of high estrogen in men.  so many chemicals get cocktailed together and cause an endocrine disruption.

they make products that are safe to use but they are not sold in normal stores.   Herban Cowboy, Dessert Essentials to name a few.

Fabric softeners are bad so are most laundry soaps.   

ECOS seems to be ok .  The list just keeps going.  

if you are sick and no one can figure it out.  start with what you eat and touch every day and work your way back.  waiting on them to save you is not an option when time is as fast as it is.

the human brain is made of omega3 fatty acids. There are 3 types of omega3: ALA, EPA, and DHA. The brain is made from DHA. There is only one natural source of DHA: algae, and fish that eat algae. Walnuts, flax seeds,  etc are NOT DHA.

Many people, especially males and older people, do not convert food sources of ALA to DHA very efficiently. In these cases the body will incorporate nonDHA fatty acids into the membrane of the brain. However there is at least some evidence that this leads to suboptimal results like emotional or mood issues, attention issues, or anger issues. However the specifics are widely debated

Reply,e3b0vys,934q6t,"Because most ""fancy"" salt or salt meant for a specific purpose isn't iodized. You only really find general purpose table salt and some sea salt to be iodized. 

But again, that makes sense. People who buy their fancy Himalayan pink salt don't want added iodine because they want the pure ""natural"" chemicals or whatever. People who bake with salt don't general want added iodine because it can impart an off flavor when baked. Same for people who want to do brines. And so on. 

 Never the less, 90% of the salt sold is the cheap table salt variety which does contain iodine. The number of products does not tell you what people buy. There is only one cheapest brand of anything, and yet most people will buy that. We have options to buy both easily because there are good reasons to buy both. That is a good thing. 

In general, the more choices you have the better. If the government starts a smear campaign against iodized salt, sure. Or if you find it impossible to buy iodized salt or other iodine supplements all of a sudden than sure. But the fact that we have a choice is not a cause for worry. Instead, worry when your choices are being made for you. ",None,comment
